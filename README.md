# SCWorkflow Conda Packages
Workflow Package for Analysis of Single Cell Data

The Single Cell Workflow streamlines the analysis of multimodal Single Cell RNA-Seq data produced from 10x Genomics.  It can be run in a docker container, and for biologists, in user-friendly web-based interactive notebooks (NIDAP, Palantir Foundry). Much of it is based on the Seurat workflow in Bioconductor, and supports CITE-Seq data.  It incorporates a cell identification step (ModScore) that utilizes module scores obtained from Seurat and also includes Harmony for batch correction.

This brnach is to store Conda Packages.
